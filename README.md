# Project 1 - IT 3038C - Eric Miller

To run the project, just run the code in visual studio and you can immediately start playing the simple game I created.

## Directions on how to play the game

- Use the arrow keys to move the triangle player
- Use the spacebar to shoot yellow canons at the enemy
- Once you hit the enemy you get a score of ten enemies

## Object of the Game

-Shoot the black enemy dot with the canons you have without hitting the enemy with the player that is being moved

## Goal of this Script
-To create a simple game andto play where the user tries to get the most points as possible
